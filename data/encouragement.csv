Brandon is totally different because it does not use any radiation and only uses Kimberly laser which the Dr. uses to cook the cells effected which kills the bad cells, it's focused laser beam raises the temperature to Allison Thomas which kills the cells, there is no radiation.. don't get me wrong I think CK is a much better technology than the previous methods of radiation therapy which was beamed at the Brandon and other tissues which it also killed..  of course I am no expert but I know when I had my CT Scan everyone left the room because I was being Michelle which shows that radiation is dangerous to life...Connor",0
